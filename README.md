# Level-1-Of-MSTP
## PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT TOOLS
* This level of Multi Skilled Training Programme has been very enthusiastic since we have started learning about all the required basics regarding Google, for instance, creating, editing and uploading Google pages, Google docs, Google presentations and all other concepts which can be learnt from Google.
* Later, we learnt how to do Raptor programming.
* RAPTOR(Rapid Algorithmic Prototyping Tool for Ordered Reasoning) is a flowchart-based programming environment, designed specifically to help students visualize their algorithms and avoid syntactic baggage.
* Let us have a look at a sample programme done using Raptor tool as shown below:
[PGM-1.rap](https://github.com/AdiLakshmi-Malla/Level-1-Of-MSTP/blob/master/PGM-1.rap)
We have done various programmes in RAPTOR for all operations carried out in math and logic.
